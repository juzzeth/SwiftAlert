# SwiftAlert
Signed copies of the masterpiece Folklore by Taylor Swift were briefly available to buy online at 2am AEST, 17/10/2020. Although copies were still available for those in the USA, the international copies were long gone by the time I noticed. I wasn't keen on setting a 2am alarm to check each night, and I decided against freight-forwarding as that was looking expensive for a CD. After refreshing the page a few times without any luck, I thought there must be an easier way - and there was.

This Python script scrapes the product page for the <a href="https://store.taylorswift.com/products/the-limited-edition-signed-in-the-trees-edition-deluxe-cd-international-customers-only">international signed CD</a> and checks the product availability. If there is no availability, the script sleeps and repeats after a set amount of time. If the product is available, the script sends a notification to Pushbullet, which I have on my phone. I set my phones Pushbullet notification tone to an obnoxious sound sure to wake me from the deepest of sleeps, and made sure it would not take notice of the phones "Do Not Disturb" mode.

At 3:28am AEST, 20/10/2020, I was awoken by the obnoxious sound I spoke of earlier. It took me a moment to realize what was going on, but within 3 minutes I had very sleepily purchased my very own signed copy of Folklore.
